# ABSTRACT

**A HIGH-LEVEL DESIGN FRAMEWORK ILLUSTRATING TECHNOLOGY MIGRATION**

University of New Hampshire, December, 1993

This thesis presents a comprehensive high-level design framework which
embodies the multiplicity of system models (from physical to behavioral)
and microsystem technologies (from standard parts to multichip modules (MCMs))
as well as the interrelations between them (vertical and horizontal design
methodologies). This framework is used as a guide to understand, view and
analyze all areas of complex system development, especially technology
migration (e.g. integrating logic using field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)
instead of standard parts). The description tool VHDL provides a means to
accomplish technology migration as demonstrated in two practical applications:
laboratory experiments of a NASA Host Interface Serial Controller (HISC) and
an 8-bit microprocessor design, both functionally implemented using an
FPGA technology.
