# PREFACE

This thesis was developed as a result of multiple projects I have accomplished
at the University of New Hampshire (UNH). The accumulated experience enabled
me to compose the foundation and formalisms of an enhanced design framework
presented in this thesis. The projects are as follows:

* Developed a complete set of nine Texas Instruments (Tl) laboratory experiments
introducing designers to fast in-house complex digital system development
(Refer to
[Appendices C](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-masters-thesis/blob/master/appendices/appendix-c/appendix-c.md)-K).
The laboratories have been published in a TI book
"Introduction to FPGA-Based Microsystem Design"
[[RuHl93]](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-masters-thesis/blob/master/references/references.md#ruhl93).

* Implemented an 8-bit parallel-to-serial and serial-to-parallel converter for
the National Aeronautics and Space Agency's (NASAs) rocket project using a
CMOS standard-cell, very large scale integration (VLSI) process.
This application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), also known as the
Aydin Vector Serial/Parallel Interface (AVSPI), is part of a larger system
which is used to gather gamma ray information in the upper atmosphere.
The system is currently used on board rockets and will eventually be
placed in a NASA satellite
[[Deco91a]](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-masters-thesis/blob/master/references/references.md#deco91a).

* Built a stand-alone speaker dependent speech recognition system using
TIs TMS320 digital signal processing (DSP) chip and standard parts in a
realÂ­time environment
[[Deco91b]](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-masters-thesis/blob/master/references/references.md#deco91b).

* Used the description tool VHDL to model, simulate and synthesize a
programmable 8-bit microprocessor for implementation with a Xilinx field
programmable gate array (FPGA). The system is capable of decoding a small
instruction set and was based on a standard part implementation
[[SeFi91]](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-masters-thesis/blob/master/references/references.md#sefi91).
It was completely modeled in structural VHDL code, written specifically
for an FPGA using hard and soft macros (Refer to
[Appendix L](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-masters-thesis/blob/master/appendices/appendix-l/appendix-l.md))
[[Deco92]](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-masters-thesis/blob/master/references/references.md#deco92).

* Analyzed the Mentor Graphics electronic design automation (EDA) environment,
a collection of tools built around the Falcon Framework. The design environment
provides VHDL EDA tools as well as multichip module (MCM) development capabilities
[[Ment92]](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-masters-thesis/blob/master/references/references.md#ment92)
[[Ment91a-f]](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-masters-thesis/blob/master/references/references.md#ment91a)
[[Ment90a-b]](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-masters-thesis/blob/master/references/references.md#ment90a).

* Attended a one week intensive training session on VHDL logic synthesis
at Viewlogic. Various VHDL modeling styles tailored specifically to their
synthesis system were examined
[[View93]](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-masters-thesis/blob/master/references/references.md#view93).
