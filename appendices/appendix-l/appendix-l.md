# APPENDIX L

**NOTE:** _I translated the following programable 8-bit microprocessor
in my Thesis, from VHDL to verilog, and have a full working synthesizable
example in
[my-systemverilog-examples](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-systemverilog-examples/tree/master/systems/microprocessors/programable-8-bit-microprocessor)
repo._

### II. GENERIC VHDL TEST GENERATION TEMPLATE

**NOTE:** _I translated the original VHDL in my Thesis into
verilog and have a full working testbench in
[my-systemverilog-examples](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-systemverilog-examples/tree/master/systems/microprocessors/programable-8-bit-microprocessor)
repo._

### III. STRUCTURAL VHDL DESCRIPTION OF THE 8-BIT MICROPROCESSOR

**NOTE:** _Keeping the exact same structure, ports, and logic, I translated the
original VHDL in my Thesis into verilog and have a full working synthesizable
example in
[my-systemverilog-examples](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-systemverilog-examples/tree/master/systems/microprocessors/programable-8-bit-microprocessor)
repo._
