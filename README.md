## ABSTRACT

This thesis presents a comprehensive high-level design framework which embodies the multiplicity of system models (from physical to behavioral) and microsystem technologies (from standard parts to multichip modules (MCMs)) as well as the interrelations between them (vertical and horizontal design methodologies). This framework is used as a guide to understand, view and analyze all areas of complex system development, especially technology migration (e.g. integrating logic using field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) instead of standard parts). The description tool VHDL provides a means to accomplish technology migration as demonstrated in two practical applications: laboratory experiments of a NASA Host Interface Serial Controller (HISC) and an 8-bit microprocessor design, both functionally implemented using an FPGA technology.
