## CONCLUSIONS

This thesis presented a high-level design framework in which all important areas
of complex system development can be understood, viewed and analyzed.
This framework is offered as a solution to the confusion that can arise due
to the multiplicity of system paradigms (models), EDA tools, microsystem
technologies and the interrelations between them (design methodologies).
Technology migration is inherent to this enhanced design framework,
illustrating the integration of future microsystem technologies.

The information contained herein also provides designers with a practical
guide in many areas, enabling them to:

* Contrast low and high-level design frameworks and their associated elements
  (system models, EDA tools, microsystem technologies and design methodologies).
* To incorporate new EDA tools into the design framework.
* Learn about various VHDL modeling techniques.
* Complete FPGA development.

To prove the existence of this enhanced design framework, the past and
present of microsystem development was illustrated. The past was shown
through the design of a HISC using the schematic capture description tool
within the low-level framework. The present was illustrated by using a VHDL
description tool within the high-level framework.

For future steps, more work needs to take place to formulate and foster
the highÂ­ level design framework. An interesting area lies in adding a
third dimension to the framework, incorporating a new design methodology
(i.e. a design methodology (up), within a design methodology (horizontal),
within a design methodology (vertical)).

Finally, UNH will take part in the growing use of the high-level design framework.
Some of the work planned at UNH that will adhere to the rules and
principles in this thesis are:

* MCM implementation of a high-speed Cerebellar Model Arithmetic
  Computer (CMAC) for audible applications.
* NASA Equator-S project consisting of high-speed banks of counters.
* Matra Marconi project, similar to NASA.
* Second Texas Instruments laboratory manual in the area of testing
  and testability.
