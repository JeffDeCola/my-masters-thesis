# CHAPTER 2

## DESIGN DOMAIN, DESIGN FRAMEWORK AND TECHNOLOGY MIGRATION IN MICROSYSTEM DEVELOPMENT

This chapter is organized into three sections, beginning with an introduction of
the digital design domain in Section 2.1. The digital design domain is a
time-independent (static) graphical representation of three basic interrelated
elements used for viewing a digital system: microsystem technologies,
description tools and the conceptual-system. This section also describes the
design domain as viewed by schematic capture and VHDL description tools showing
the benefits and limitations as to how they affect the designer. Section 2.2
explains the development of the design framework as a time-dependent (dynamic)
representation of the design domain. The low and high-level frameworks are also
discussed herein. The design framework contains system models, EDA tools,
microsystem technologies and design methodologies. The framework is used
throughout the thesis to view and analyze all aspects of system development.
Lastly, Section 2.3 introduces technology migration, a key element within
the high-level design framework.

## 2.1 Design Domain

The digital design domain is a collection of three basic interrelated elements:
microsystem technologies, description tools and the conceptual-system as shown
in Figure 2.1. The latter two elements are defined as:

* Description tools are software tools used to help a designer create,
at a certain abstraction layer, a model of a system. Schematic capture and
HDL are two popular tools.
* The *conceptual-system element* represents the designer's idea
(i.e. knowledge and specifications) of a system, as opposed to the term
'system' by itself, which implies a physical structure.

The digital design domain represents a designer's view of a digital system
[Gajs91]. It is important because it formulates the foundation of the
design framework.
